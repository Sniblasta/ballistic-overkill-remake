    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: red;">Ballistic Overkill Revival</h1><hr>

    <p style="text-align: center; color: red;"><strong> !!!This Project Is Non-Fundable!!!</strong> </p><hr>

   <h2> <p style="text-align:center;">This Project was made to revive <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/296300/Ballistic_Overkill/">Ballistic Overkill</a></p>

   <p style="text-align: center;"> that was originated from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6ZaPCfnoDY">Facebook Game</a> after it's shut down</p>

   <p style="text-align: center;"> because of the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/end-of-life-alternative.html">Closure Of Flash Player.</a> </p>

   <p style="text-align: center;"> Now a small group of new developers are trying to revive the game and bring new features like:</p>

   <p> <strong></strong></p><li style="text-align: center;"><strong> New Maps</strong></li><p></p>

   <li style="text-align: center;">Balance Changes</li>

   <p style="text-align: center;">This Project is the first project that we decided to build something that big</p>

   <p style="text-align: center;">So we are sorry if you have any problem or any bug in the game</p>

   <p style="text-align: center;">If you want to report any bug or problem you can always contant us.</p>

   
<h2> How This Method Works?</h2><hr>
<h3><p> The way this method we use works is with a program called <a href="https://github.com/ManiacKnight/Auto-Steam-Fix-Tool-v2">Auto Steam Fix Tool V2</a>. This file modifier helps games that have Multiplayer run in original servers. Sadly you can't play with players that already own the game,they have to redownload the game from the link down below or modify the game files with the Auto Steam Fix Tools v2 but  <span style="color: red" ;=""><u><strong>WE DON'T RECOMMEND CHANGING YOUR MAIN GAME FILES!!! </strong></u>
    You can play this game with your friends or with completely random people but everyone must have the same game copy. Basically we use <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/480/">Spacewar</a> to run this game online.

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: black;">FAQ</h2>
    
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">What made you guys start this project</h3>

    <li><h4 style="text-align: left;">This game was my childhood, when I discovered that this game has moved on steam, I decided to buy it just for the nostalgia.<br>
    I purchased the game 2 months after it's closure. I gifted the game to my friends but like every other thing in life, my friends stopped playing it. <br>
    2 years after the Delisting of the game off steam, I met Gust0p and I screenshared the game throughout Discord. He liked the game but he was <br>
    disappointed when he realised that the game was delisted and if he'd like to purchase the game,it would be too expensive from a 3rd party site.<br>
    So we worked on a non steam - pirated version of the game so me and Gust0p can play together. We shared our job with our friends and it worked.<br>
    So why we decided to share it online? Well it's because me and our friends thought that sharing this game would make people that used to play<br>
    back in the day to return for a "new" experience and to bring new people into the game that haven't heard of it.

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Is it safe?</h3>

    <li><h4 style="text-align: left;"> Yes, the only thing that has been modified are the multiplayer files that have been replaced <br> 
    with the multiplayer files of Spacewar</h4></li>
